## Pageshot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-services/pageshot.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-services/pageshot)

This is a prototype for a product to create better sharable assets. It uses techniques like copying/freezing the DOM, optionally showing history, allowing inline comments, taking snippets and screenshots.

You can view the site (with a link to install the Add-on) at [pageshotpages.appspot.com](https://pageshotpages.appspot.com)

It is implemented as a Firefox Add-on, using the [Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK) and a website using Google Appengine.  The addon is in the root, and the website is in `appengine/pageshotpages/`

Ian has been blogging about the [design, definition, and development process](http://www.ianbicking.org/tag/product-journal.html).

There is an IRC channel `#pageshot` on irc.mozilla.org, though we have no particular culture or pattern in that channel; you may find a ghosttown.

Planning and ideation is happening in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ianb/pageshot/issues).  We use a pattern roughly like:

* [Issues with no milestone](https://github.com/ianb/pageshot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Amilestone) are awaiting triage
* [Issues set to the next milestone](https://github.com/ianb/pageshot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Sprint+1%22) can be worked on any time (this link will rot!)
* [Issues in Next Tasks](https://github.com/ianb/pageshot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Next+Tasks%22) will be re-triaged when the current milestone is done
* [Issues in Blue Sky](https://github.com/ianb/pageshot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Blue+Sky%22) are mostly shelved; we'd like to do them but have no plans to move forward.  (If you see something you care about there, comment on it -- otherwise we may not notice it)
* [Issues with the needs-discussion label](https://github.com/ianb/pageshot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs+discussion%22) are for discussion at the next meeting.  We don't have a plan for open meetings (not that we don't want them, we just don't have a plan), so this is largely for internal use.

Issue tags otherwise aren't very structured. [Experiment](https://github.com/ianb/pageshot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aexperiment) means that the implementation should focus on creating something usable for analysis (i.e., something we can play with), not a committed feature. [Research](https://github.com/ianb/pageshot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aresearch) is primarily analysis of other products that do something interesting, or some source material that could provide insight.  Input on these (things like "I like this because...") is very helpful!

Code contributions are not encouraged at this moment (January 2015), because the code is all throw-away, and if you contribute something we'll probably throw it away too.  Idea contributions are very welcome, as is feedback on the interface.
