  Followup in [#3083](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3083). Fixes [#2981](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2981) [af32978](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/af32978)

### Add-on changes

* Start background page if migration is needed. Fixes [#3007](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3007) [77bd749](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/77bd749)
* Minor en-US string tweaks [b038b31](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/b038b31)
* Close onboarding modal on clicking outside the slides [614877a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/614877a)
* Wait 5 seconds after startup before showing any error notifications. This change eliminates the highly-visible class of bugs where an error notification is thrown at startup. [9db01b7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9db01b7)
* Let background page load fully before loading content scripts. Fixes [#2955](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2955) [43977db](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/43977db)
* Remove fromMakeError from Sentry reports
* Sentry IP collection is turned off
* Resolve small UI nits in add-on ([#2995](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2995))* flips last two onboarding slides. Fixes [#2988](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2988) Fixes [#2986](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2986) [36579e4](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/36579e4)
* Sentry/investigative fixes ([#3003](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3003))* Avoid ui is undefined error in Browser Console when save succeeds and worker is torn down
  * avoid bad favicon URLs; avoid problem with resolveUrl and no base URL
  * Use `this.module` instead of `window.module` for `shot.js`.
  * Add watchFunction to top-level calls in modules, so stacks are saved
  * Suppress ui is not defined error. This isn't a real fix, but it keeps the popup from happening, while still reporting to Sentry (or reporting sometimes)
  * Avoid `filenameTitle is undefined`. Generally default to Screenshot for the title, for cases (like file urls) where even self.url is blank
  * Clarify in the logs when an error comes from Screenshots
  * Don't force selection when forcing onboarding, as site will trigger onboarding itself
  * avoid Invalid tab ID when an active tab is closed
  The code always tries to make the icon not-active, but one case when it tries is when the tab has been closed
  * suppress Missing host permission for the tab
  This is the expected error for about pages and other non-permitted pages. Fixes [#2968](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2968) Fixes [#2979](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2979) Fixes [#2983](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2983) Fixes [#2998](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2998) Fixes [#2990](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2990) Fixes [#2978](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2978) [2cec496](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2cec496)
* Lazily load code into the background page. This takes a minimal approach, loading scripts using the script tag on the first button click. Also creates and intercepts the contextMenu action, and any incoming communication. Reads onboarding flag and changes icon as necessary. Fixes [#2843](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2843) [8f98579](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/8f98579)
* Update icon [aff4283](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/aff4283)
* Moves button (Download/Save/etc) position if not in viewport [0d025fc](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0d025fc)
* don't give an error when document.body is missing. This notices and reports the specific element that is in the page, that isn't an HTML document

### Server changes

* Various fixes:
  * make sure contentOrigin isn't undefined in CSP header
  * avoid including README and .template files in zip
  * Fix 2767, make `update_manifest.py` resilient to a bad `manifest.json`. Also fix the logic that keeps the version always going up
  * validate backend argument for manifest
  * Fixes [#2963](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2963) [#2426](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2426) [#2679](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2679) [#2856](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2856) [#2941](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2941) [#2985](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2985) [#2967](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2967) [#2994](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2994) [#2647](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2647) [ede3337](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ede3337)
* Update npm packages. Fixes [#2991](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2991) [c17f30b](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/c17f30b)
* Hide search [1441aa6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/1441aa6)
* Hides 'copy image text' option if text capture is disabled [4102029](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/4102029)

### Development process changes

* Change the default npm run test behavior to run Nightly instead of Release ([#3008](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3008)) [13b4414](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/13b4414)
* Normalize exception stack URLs to improve Sentry grouping. Each copy of Screenshots has a unique `moz-extension://` UUID URL. Replace that base URL with `resource://screenshots-addon` for better Sentry grouping. Use 'resource', not 'moz-extension', because raven-js can't parse stack traces with 'moz-extension' URLs (raven-js bug [#974](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/974)). Fixes [#2975](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2975) [90c31d6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/90c31d6)
* Set limits in regexes [e34a871](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/e34a871)
* Removes focus from buttons on action complete [0bd7945](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0bd7945)
* Share panels reposition and remain open [db25663](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/db25663)
* Card component refactor creates a different component class for each shot; fixes circleci errors; card component code refactor [2bb3bc8](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2bb3bc8)
* Fix select list [3b839e7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/3b839e7)
* Add `web-ext --browser-console` so it always starts with the console open

## Version 9.0.0

* Handle a race condition when a shot page is loaded at startup ([#2962](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2962)). Fixes [#2958](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2958) [7637e1a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/7637e1a)
* Make empty selections report an error. Previously they were creating empty `data:` URLs and causing server rejection. Fixes [#2957](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2957) [dbeb56d](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/dbeb56d)
* Make re-saving an image work. Change the Save button to not be disabled after the timeout. Remove any previous clip images if Save is invoked twice [3c2323d](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/3c2323d)
* fix sending errors to Sentry ([#2952](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2952)). This changes the DSNs to the private DSNs in new Sentry projects. Discussion of using a private DSN in [Bug 1369162](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1369162). WebExtension background pages do not have a referrer or origin on their requests, therefore we need authenticated endpoints. Fixes [#2920](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2920) [f94bdfd](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/f94bdfd)
* Unload uicontrol event handlers properly ([#2942](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2942)). Fixes [#2838](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2838) [2d064b7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2d064b7)
* Do not localize product name in the button label [48974c7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/48974c7)
* Disable DOM text capture. Fixes [#2931](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2931) [d30ef08](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d30ef08)
* Defer the migration until local registration info has been fetched ([#2934](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2934)). Fixes migration issues and haywire notification on startup. Fixes [#2919](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2919) Fixes [#2902](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2902) [1aa0b9e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/1aa0b9e)
* better align RTL buttons [ee5f588](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ee5f588)
* Set lang and dir to html tags [d908268](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d908268)

### Server changes

* Add more structured error messages to bad submitted image URLs [308913b](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/308913b)
* allow for EXTRA_CONTENT_ORIGIN ([#2950](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2950))This adds a new configuration, EXTRA_CONTENT_ORIGIN, which is added to the CSP. This is intended just for migrating the pageshot.net content origin. Fixes [#2933](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2933) [1b746f9](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/1b746f9)
* fix select list [d7a6159](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d7a6159)

### Other changes

* Implement some small improvements to export_mc ([#2948](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2948)). Add `--no-commit` option, so you can preview the changes without causing a commit. Validate `--branch` or `--no-switch-branch` options. Make it valid Python 3 (and Python 2), even though we aren't using Python 3 [8f97a3c](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/8f97a3c)
* Update expected button label text in browser test [61b1d19](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/61b1d19)
* Note text capture can be enabled by setting the SCREENSHOTS_CAPTURE_TEXT env var to `'true'`.

* If the /creating tab is closed open a new tab instead of updating the nonexistent tab ([#2850](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2850)). Fixes [#2842](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2842) [ccb2397](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ccb2397)

### Server

* Change console.* server messages to use mozlog ([#2858](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2858)). Fixes [#2177](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2177) [98df4ec](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/98df4ec)
* make protocol configurable with EXPECT_PROTOCOL=https ([#2864](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2864)). Fixes [#2734](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2734) [a9761b6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/a9761b6)
* Fix shot index trash flicker ([#2872](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2872)) [238cc23](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/238cc23)

## Version 7.0.0

Destined for a server deploy, probably only a later version of the add-on will be imported into Firefox.

* Update documentation [ef69b80](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ef69b80) [56d919a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/56d919a) [709b3ee](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/709b3ee) [75c4ca4](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/75c4ca4)
* Stop updating the tab state on tab 'updated' eventRelocate the urlEnabled check to the button click handler, and show the unshootable page error if the url isn't enabled.
  * Removing the onUpdated handler and the many redundant setIcon calls will hopefully help fix performance issues currently preventing uplift into
  Firefox.
  * Fixes [#2824](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2824) [d830d9a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d830d9a)
* Do not update toolbar button state inside tab 'activated' event handler.  According to kmag, webextension buttons have per-tab state, so setting the button enabled or disabled on update should be enough. Updating the icon on tab activated may be causing performance issues. See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361792 for details. Also remove tab.active check, so that non-active tabs can catch button updates (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1362234#c2) [f63b90e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/f63b90e)
* Start WebExtension immediatelyStop waiting for the 'sessionstore-windows-restored' event before
  starting the WebExtension.
  See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361792 for details. [81a567a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/81a567a)
* Add dropshadow to icons for dark themes [cbfa406](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/cbfa406)
* Add a quiet parameter to watchFunction to match watchPromise ([#2795](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2795))
  Quiet the watchFunction calls in tabs.onUpdated and tabs.onActivated, that should never pop up a message [1add819](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/1add819)
* Set Sentry URL when exporting to m-c. Fixes [#2782](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2782) [576a9c8](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/576a9c8)

### Server changes:

* Add landing page UI [166e079](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/166e079)
* Remove duplicate meta description in head [f5c5509](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/f5c5509)
* Remove robots.txt and replace with meta noindex making Twitter cards work again Invalidates [#2805](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2805). Fixes [#2806](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2806) Fixes [#2774](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2774) [1c6efd6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/1c6efd6)
* Disable all active A/B tests. Fixes [#2796](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2796) [ddcb7fc](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ddcb7fc) [0726fd0](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0726fd0)
* Make clip image.onload resilient. This duplicates some of the React logic that shows the clip image when it loads, but will run even if the bundle doesn't load or there's other Javascript errors. Fixes [#2792](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2792) Fixes [#2651](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2651) [60adfea](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/60adfea)
* Allow JS to run even when ga-activation.js is suppressed. Fixes [#2790](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2790) [bf39dc4](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/bf39dc4)
* Send only referrer origin to GA. Fixes [#2717](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2717) [4883e11](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/4883e11)
* Fix email address. Fixes [#2791](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2791) [46915c5](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/46915c5)
* Extended direct-view event with ownership. closes [#2143](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2143) [0cc662c](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0cc662c)
* Inline style/image on /#hello. Fixes [#2703](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2703) [97e75bb](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/97e75bb)
* Complete screenshots style refactor [4723a92](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/4723a92)
* Clarify how Do Not Track affects does not affect error reporting

## Version 6.6.2

Another version landing in the non-master latest-firefox-export branch.

* Stop updating the button icon when the tab is updated ([#2824](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2824))
* Also pull in updated icons that have already landed in master ([#2817](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2817))

## Version 6.6.1

* Correctly set Sentry URL when exporting to mozilla-central ([#2782](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2782))

This version includes two changes that addressed Talos performance regressions discussed in [https://bugzil.la/1361792](https://bugzil.la/1361792):

* Do not update toolbar button state inside tab 'activated' event handler ([#2800](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2800))
* Start the WebExtension immediately, instead of waiting for the 'sessionstore-windows-restored' event ([#2813](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2813))

Note also that these changes have been added to Firefox directly on top of the 6.6.0 release, not on top of current master; the divergence is tracked
by the `latest-firefox-export` branch.

## Version 6.6.0

* Change metrics preference to `datareporting.healthreport.uploadEnabled` ([#2785](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2785))
  This preference is enabled on all channels, while the previous preference (`toolkit.telemetry.enabled`) is not enabled on Release (but is enabled on Beta, etc). Fixes [#2783](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2783) [8820967](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/8820967)
* Add left/right keyboard shortcuts to onboarding slides [709d5b1](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/709d5b1)
* call `URL.revokeObjectURL()` after download completes ([#2777](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2777)). Fixes [#2776](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2776) [db8e708](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/db8e708)
* Fix the detection of shot pages for Screenshots button disabling/activation ([#2780](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2780)) [32d45bc](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/32d45bc)

## Version 6.5.0

(Note: this version was never released, all its changes are bundled in 6.6.0)

* Pixel-snap-icon [7c804b4](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/7c804b4)
* Fix testIfLoaded (used in onboarding) so it can see when a load is in progress ([#2762](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2762)) [c521008](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/c521008)
* Update dependencies [290b047](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/290b047)
* Improve the mochitest to wait for the button to appear before starting. Also use the mochitest config from the mozilla plugin to save specifying globals. ([#2759](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2759))
  * Correctly enable the mozilla plugin for ESLint [5c6733e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5c6733e)
* disable selection when mouseup is in the scroll area ([#2726](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2726)). Fixes [#2698](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2698) [9392fe3](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9392fe3)
* don't cancel the shot process when the upload fails.

## Version 6.4.0

* Improve Selenium tests For CircleCI:
  - start server before starting Selenium tests
  - Make sure the pref for system-disabled is True before installing (to workaround [#2712](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2712)), and False before running tests
  - Make channel configurable via `$FIREFOX_CHANNEL` Allow the tester to keep the window open with `$NO_CLOSE`
  - Create a test that clicks the Screenshots button, skips onboarding, clicks Save Visible, and confirms a tab opens with a shot URL
  - Make driver instantiation, which includes installing the add-on, async and blocking on add-on installation.
  - Fixes [#2695](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2695) [54aa574](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/54aa574)
* Small Makefile improvements: Add `make bootstrap_zip` to build a zip that includes bootstrap.js;  Silence the messages from pontoon-to-webext; Clarify that `install.rdf` depends on `package.json` [d44f34a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d44f34a)
* 404 images from expired shots [cb27e40](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/cb27e40)
* manually dim toolbar button when disabledOn Windows and Linux, WebExtension toolbar buttons are not automatically dimmed when a button is disabled (bug 1204609). Fixes [#2708](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2708) [b1415f6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/b1415f6)
* Shutdown the embedded webExtension when bootstrap is asked to shutdown ([#2712](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2712)) [9a23339](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9a23339)
* Use Content-Disposition for downloading images [defb4b2](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/defb4b2)
* use JS to open terms and privacy links on clickThis workaround is required because of a bug with e10s handling of https URLs inside moz-extension pages. Fixes [#2699](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2699) [88a0ed6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/88a0ed6)
* Stop Errors being shown when browser.tabs.get() fails as a result of tabs going away too quick, e.g. browser mochitests. [11ec080](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/11ec080)
* - Apply Mozilla ESLint style, and fix resulting issues. Fixes [#2365](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2365) [03ad681](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/03ad681)  [ac25801](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ac25801)  [f493102](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/f493102)

* added load_test_exercise.py to circleci [9d42d8b](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9d42d8b)
* Remove embedded web extension in install manifest. ([#2688](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2688)). This causes the embedded web extension to be parsed at startup, and triggers a race condition in existing Firefox code during startup on a clean profile between AddonManager and devtools code. Removing this is not an issue for Screenshots because it delays startup of the embedded web extension until "sessionstore-windows-restored" is observed anyway.  See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1356394 for more info. [2fa25c6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2fa25c6)

## Version 6.3.0 & 6.2.0

  so that we don't export empty l10n files as we just fallback to en-US. Fixes [#2642](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2642) [211dcf6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/211dcf6)

## Version 6.1.0

* Change the mochitest to work with the system-disabled pref rather than the user facing pref. ([#2637](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2637))
  This makes the test work better due to the fact the extension will be disabled in-tree via the system-disabled pref. [bf62e73](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/bf62e73)

  * abstract out sendToBootstrap error checking. Fixes [#2596](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2596) Fixes [#2603](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2603) [ebe57df](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ebe57df)

* Combine `configure-raven.js` with the `raven.js`
  client, into `/install-raven.js`. Load raven via require() instead of a direct
  link.  Remove the now-unneeded `static/vendor/` directory, and Makefile rules
  related to it. Fixes [#1801](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1801) [6841236](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/6841236)
* Combine `parent-helper.js` and

* Increase default period of time to check for
  deleted shots from 1 minute to 1 hour. Fixes [#1865](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1865) [7589d5e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/7589d5e)
* Add GA logging for any shots that are deleted
  after the expiration time. Fixes [#1692](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1692) [dcb380b](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/dcb380b)
* Move the share panel and button entirely into its
  own component fix share panel alignment when extension
  notification banner is in place. Fixes [#1714](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1714) Fixes [#1565](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1565) [ab468fd](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ab468fd)
* (v2.4) check before trying to call window.sendToChild,
  which is safely missing on most pages. Fixes [#1910](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1910) [5333ae7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5333ae7)

## Version 1

### Visible changes to the product

* For each release we'll be adding one to the next version (i.e., the version after this will be Version 2)
* There is a "Save Full Page" and "Save visible" option for saving either the full length of the page, or the entire visible portion of the page.
* The add-on now automatically copies the shot URL to the clipboard.
* The autoselection when you click will now be previewed with a white box as you hover.
  * Also improvements to the autoselection algorithm, avoiding very small selections.
* Some URLs were being rejected: those with ports, `view-source` URLs, and URLs in some situations where the content was cached.
* Search on My Shots is now done as you type.
* Improvements to the selection itself:
  * You can drag the selection
  * You can invert the selection when resizing
  * You can drag out a new selection over the old selection
* In some error conditions the tool would become unresponsive on a tab.
* Server authentication could be lost (for instance with a cookie destroying add-on).  We now attempt to re-login if we detect the cookies are gone.
