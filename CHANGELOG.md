* Combine `configure-raven.js` with the `raven.js`
  client, into `/install-raven.js`. Load raven via require() instead of a direct
  link.  Remove the now-unneeded `static/vendor/` directory, and Makefile rules
  related to it. Fixes [#1801](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1801) [6841236](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/6841236)
* Combine `parent-helper.js` and

* Increase default period of time to check for
  deleted shots from 1 minute to 1 hour. Fixes [#1865](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1865) [7589d5e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/7589d5e)
* Add GA logging for any shots that are deleted
  after the expiration time. Fixes [#1692](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1692) [dcb380b](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/dcb380b)
* Move the share panel and button entirely into its
  own component fix share panel alignment when extension
  notification banner is in place. Fixes [#1714](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1714) Fixes [#1565](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1565) [ab468fd](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ab468fd)
* (v2.4) check before trying to call window.sendToChild,
  which is safely missing on most pages. Fixes [#1910](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1910) [5333ae7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5333ae7)

* Don't recreate the metrics if they are fresh enough Make the
  polling interval on refreshing metrics slightly randomized, so multiple
  workers don't pile on [8d61f00](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/8d61f00)
* send Raven report when metrics updating fails
  Allow REFRESH_METRICS_TIME to be 0, disabling the refresh. Fixes [#1946](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1946) [e4da720](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/e4da720)

* The autoselection when you click will now be previewed with a white box as you hover.
  * Also improvements to the autoselection algorithm, avoiding very small selections.

  * You can invert the selection when resizing
  * You can drag out a new selection over the old selection
